## 1. List and define the concepts and terms included in the pages above.

- **Relationship type**: A meaningful connection between entity types that helps answer questions we couldn't answer with just the entity types alone.
- **Relationship instance**: A specific link between instances of entities, where each instance connects exactly one instance from each involved entity type.
- **Associative entity**: An entity type that links instances of one or more entity types and has attributes unique to the relationship between those instances.
- **Unary relationship**: A relationship between instances of the same entity type.
- **Binary relationship**: A relationship between instances of two entity types, which is the most common in data modeling.
- **Ternary relationship**: A relationship involving instances of three entity types at the same time.
- **Cardinality constraint**: Defines how many instances of entity B can or must be linked to each instance of entity A.
- **Minimum cardinality**: The least number of instances of entity B that can be associated with an instance of entity A.
- **Maximum cardinality**: The most number of instances of entity B that can be linked to an instance of entity A.

## 2. Using your example from R3, diagram and describe the relationships between the various entities.
Entities can have multiple relationships. Use action verbs to describe a relationship. (avoid "is", "has")

## 3. Exercise 2-3 (c, e, h)

- **c. Entity type**: A category or class of objects in the real world, which is more like what the things are that we want to model in a database.
- **Relationship type**: A meaningful association between two or more entity types, which is how these entities are connected.
  
- **e. Degree vs. Cardinality**:
  - **Degree**: How many entity types are involved in a relationship. For example, using the zoo analogy, one lion hunts one zebra.
  - **Cardinality**: How many instances of one entity can link to another. For example, one lion hunts many zebras. Degree is about the number of entities, while cardinality is about the quantity of connections.
  
- **h. Ternary relationship vs. Three binary relationships**:
  - **Ternary relationship**: One relationship connecting three entities at once, like a lion hunts a zebra and a tiger.
  - **Three binary relationships**: Three separate pairwise connections like "Lion hunts zebra," "Tiger hunts zebra," and "Lion kills tiger." Ternary shows all three entities connected together, while binary breaks them into separate, simpler links but loses the full context.

## 4. Exercise 2-11
- **One to one**, **one to many**, **many to many**, **many to one**

## 5. Exercise 2-13
- **Unary Relationship**: Such as "A lion is eating with another lion," two examples of the same entity.
- **Binary Relationships**: If it were "A lion is eating with a zebra," two different entities.
- **Ternary Relationships**: Are like "A lion is eating with a zebra and a tiger," three different entities.

## 6. Exercise 2-22
My guess is because in an associative entity, it is easier to represent the relationship between the different entities through many-to-many relationships.
